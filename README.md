# Ship-game---class-project

This is a simple game project made entirely on classes

Basic things that you can do in this game:
- add player with ship
- specify the parameters of the ship like max crew, capacity, speed
- generating map with Islands (all coordinates are randomly generated)
- buying stuff from specific store (with randomly generated cargos) if you have enough money, free space on ship and if you are on the right island

This game was created for educational purposes
